Barebones implementation:
This is a ReactJS + Python flask web-app for sorting images into groups.

The images consist of two types:

(i) friendly humans (referred to as _human_),

![Friendly Human](human_example.jpg)

(ii) killer robots (referred to as _terminator_).

![Killer Robot](robot_example.jpg)

The image metadata includes a _group_ field, specifying whether the corresponding image is an image of a terminator, or a human, respectively.
